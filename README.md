# TATPlugin_Teams
TextAnalysisTool DLL plugin to parse Teams logs

Will parse data from Logs.txt, the main web log, and the web calling log - mainly. Still work in progress for other logs.

Place the DLL in the same directory with TextAnalysisTool.Net (the executable).
Drop certain Teams logs into the UI for TextAnalysisTool.Net - and it will pull data out and place it at the top of the file in the UI.
